# Comparison operators:
You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be.
- == is equal to.
- !== is not equal to.
- === is strict equal to.
- !=== strict is not equal to.
- > greater than. 
- < less then.
- >= greater than or equal to.
- <= less than or equal to.
Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false.
- && Logical and. 
- || Logical or.
- ! Logical not.
# For and while loops: 
- For: if you need to run code a specific number of times, use a for loop and is made up of three statements is initialization and condition and update.
- While: If you don't know how many times should a code run.
- Do while: is very similar to the while loop, but has no key difference.
