# What is script?
Is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task.
# Expressions: 
Rely on things called operators, they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
# Functions:
Let you group a series of statemenets together to perform a specific task. 
To create a function, you give it name, and then write a statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.
You can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.
- to declare a function that needs specific information you give it parameters. 
So when you call a function that has parameters you specify the values it should use in parentheses that follow its name, that are called arguments.
- Some functions return information to the code that called them.
