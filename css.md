# CSS:

- To understand how css works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
- Rules are made up of selectors and declarations.
- Selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations made of two parts: 
1- the properties of the element that you want to change.
2- the values of those properties.

# color: 

- color brings your site to life and help convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- we can specify it by: RGB values, hex codes, color names.
- we can find the color by color pickers.
- There has to be a different between the writing and the background color so people can read your content.
- you can specify your color by RGB values, it's known as RGBA.
- and you can also specify by HSL values and with an optional opacity value, it's known as HSLA.
