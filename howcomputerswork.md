# How do computres work? 
# what makes a computer, a computer?
It has to these things:
1-Input : it's when you tell a computer to do stuff.
2- Storage and processing: The computer takes the input and store it in a memory and then manipulates it, and then send the processed information to memory again.
3- Output: this step depends on what the computer do.
#  Binary and data:
Inside a computer is electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in the computer, with more bits in the wire you can represent more complex information.
- Binary number system: it only has two digits 0 1, and with them we can count to any number.
and even it can represent text, images, and sound.
# Circuits and Logic:
circuits is made of millions of teeny electronic componets.
How circuits modify and process information?
The signal that goes in is not the same as the signal that comes out, and so we call this circuit not.
# Memory,Cpu,Input and output:
Input: converts physical input to binary information.
Memory: stores information. 
CPU: central processing unit calculates information.
Output: converts infortmation to phsical output.
# Hardware and software:
Hardware is made of all sorts of stuff like circuits,plugs,speakers,wires,chips.
Software: is all of the computer programs, or code, running on this machine.
inside every computer is an operating system managing Software that controls the computer's hardware.
